# Empty

This is the most useless package ever. It does nothing at all!
*empty* is just an empty module that you can use, for example,
to store global variables that you can share between modules.

Add variables as empty.var = val,
then import the module somewhere else and use them as empty.var

Don't blame me if it does not work ;)

## Install
<code>python setup.py install</code>
